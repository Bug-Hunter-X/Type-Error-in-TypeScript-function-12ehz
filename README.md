This repository contains a simple TypeScript program that demonstrates a common type error. The function `greeter` expects a string argument, but the program attempts to pass it an array of strings. This results in a type error. The solution demonstrates how to modify the program to fix the error.  The error highlights the importance of type checking in TypeScript and how it can help to catch errors early in the development process.
